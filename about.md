I am Ivan Kohut (Ivan Koh√∫t in Slovak), passionate software developer interested in Agile development with the focus on the quality of the code. It means implementing the simplest solution possible using [object oriented programming](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html) and test driven development in pair programming manner.
Refactoring all the time, fixing even the smallest code smells, not satisfied until static code analyzer finds nothing. Spotting duplication where others do not. Delighted in removing unnecessary code.

I mostly write backend Java code (Oracle Certified Professional - Java 8 and Oracle Certified Expert - JPA 2.0 certificates). I also got in touch with Groovy, Python and JavaScript in last few years. Two year long experience with Scala (2014-2016) positively influenced my coding style, however, I could not get used to long compilation times (I was raised on Pascal) and weak IDE support. I hope I still have some knowledge of Delphi I was using decade ago in my first job and before in university.
