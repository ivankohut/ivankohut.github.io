I am Ivan Kohut (Ivan Kohút in Slovak), a passionate software developer interested in Agile development, with a focus on code quality. This means implementing the simplest possible solution using [object oriented programming](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html) and test driven development in pair-programming manner.
Refactoring all the time, fixing even the smallest code smells, not satisfied until the static code analyzer finds nothing. Spotting duplication where others do not. Taking delight in removing unnecessary code.

I primarily write backend Java code and hold an Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 17 Developer certificate. Over the past few years, I have also worked with Groovy, Python, and JavaScript. My two years of experience with Scala (2014–2016) positively influenced my coding style, however, I could not get used to its long compilation times (having been raised on Pascal) and the weak IDE support available at that time.
